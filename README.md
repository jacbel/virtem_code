**If you want to browse the code, maybe visit the project's [GitPages](https://jacbel.github.io/virtem_code/), which are intended to provide readable research documentation including the code.**

The code implements the analysis of the virtual time project (**virtem** for short as it investigates the impact of **vir**tual **tem**poral distances on event representations in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex). It is based on R markdown files that implement the individual analysis steps. The individual markdown files are merged using bookdown.
